# Generating Projector YAML Files

`natto` can generate three types of projectors, each stored as a YAML file.
The `generate_*.py` scripts in this directory generate the corresponding YAML files:

- `generate_tensor_product_projector.py` generates `tensor_product_projector.yaml`
- `generate_decomposition_and_reconstruction_projector.py` generates `decomposition_and_reconstruction_projector.yaml`
- `generate_unit_vector_projector.py` generates `unit_vector_projector.yaml`

Run a script directly to generate the corresponding YAML file, e.g.:

```bash
python generate_tensor_product_projector.py
```

Each script allows configuring which ranks or tensor types to include; edit the
parameters at the top of the script before running.

The three projector types are described below.


# unit_vector_projector.yaml

This projector `H` maps a unit vector to a natural tensor of a given rank, i.e. it
extracts the rank-l irreducible component from the outer products of a unit vector.
The file contains the symbolic and numerical values of `H` along with the einsum rule
to apply it.

The data is organized in the following way:

{rank-normalization:
    {"H_symbolic": symbolic expression for the projector H,
    "H_numerical": numerical values of the projector H,
    "rule": einsum rule to apply the projector H to get the natural tensor from the unit vector
    }
}

- In "rank-normalization", rank is a positive integer that indicates the rank of the
  natural tensor to be constructed, and normalization can be `none` or `unity`,
  indicating whether the projector H is normalized or not.


# tensor_product_projector.yaml

This projector `H` performs the Clebsch-Gordan-like coupling of two natural tensors of
ranks l1 and l2 into a new natural tensor of rank l3.
The file contains the symbolic and numerical values of `H` along with the einsum rule
to apply it.

The data is organized in the following way:

{l1-l2-l3-normalization:
    {"H_symbolic": symbolic expression for the projector H,
    "H_numerical": numerical values of the projector H,
    "rule": einsum rule to apply the projector H to get the natural tensor from the two input natural tensors
    }
}

- In "l1-l2-l3-normalization", l1 and l2 are the ranks of the two input natural tensors,
  l3 is the rank of the output natural tensor, and normalization can be `none` or
  `unity`, indicating whether the projector H is normalized or not.


# decomposition_and_reconstruction_projector.yaml

These projectors decompose a physical Cartesian tensor (e.g. polarizability, elasticity)
into its natural tensor components and reconstruct it back. Specifically:

- `extraction` extracts a natural tensor component from the physical tensor.
- `embedding` embeds a natural tensor component back into the physical tensor space.
- `projector` is their composition, taking the physical tensor straight to its
  weight-`l`, channel-`p` part without forming the natural tensor.

The file contains the symbolic and numerical values of the three for each
physical tensor and each natural tensor component (labeled by its weight).

The data is organized in the following way:

{physical_tensor_name:
    {"rank": rank of the physical tensor,
     "symmetry": symmetry of the physical tensor,
     "GHS":
        weight:
            {"embedding": [{"symbolic": symbolic expression,
                   "numerical": numerical values }],
             "extraction": [{"symbolic": symbolic expression,
                   "numerical": numerical values }],
             "decomposition": [{"symbolic": symbolic expression,
                   "numerical": numerical values }]
            }
    }
}

- "physical_tensor_name" is the name of the physical tensor, such as "polarizability" "
elasticity".
- "weight" is the weight of the natural tensor in the decomposition of the physical
  tensor, which is a positive integer.
