r"""Coupling of two irreducible Cartesian tensors into a third.

The coupling operator $\mathbf{K}_{(\ell_3 \mid \ell_1, \ell_2)}$ of Eqs. (47)
and (48) takes natural tensors $\mathbf{X}^{\ell_1}$ and $\mathbf{Y}^{\ell_2}$
to the weight-$\ell_3$ tensor of their product,

$$\mathbf{Z}^{\ell_3} = \mathbf{K}_{(\ell_3 \mid \ell_1, \ell_2)}
\odot^{\ell_1} \mathbf{X}^{\ell_1} \odot^{\ell_2} \mathbf{Y}^{\ell_2},$$

the Cartesian counterpart of a Clebsch-Gordan coefficient. Two closed forms
build it, one for each parity of $\ell_1 + \ell_2 - \ell_3$; the odd one carries
a Levi-Civita symbol. `get_coupling_operator` dispatches on that parity, so a
caller supplies only the three weights.

The scale is not fixed by the construction. One factor per weight triple is
free, and the normalization constants $C$ of Eqs. (49) and (50) fix it, one per
parity; `tests/test_coupling.py` asserts the two conditions they come from.

## Why this is not a call into `GHS`

This is the only route to the coupling, and it is a closed form rather than a
call into the general symmetry machinery of `GHS`. That is worth explaining,
since $\mathbf{X} \otimes \mathbf{Y}$ is symmetric within its first $\ell_1$
indices and within its last $\ell_2$, which is an intrinsic symmetry in the
ordinary sense, and the symmetry route does apply to it.

Applying it is not enough on its own. What reduces the weight-$\ell_3$ mapping
space to a single dimension is a second property: $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$
are traceless, so a contraction taken inside either vanishes and only
contractions between the two survive. Tracelessness is not an index permutation,
so no symmetry string expresses it and the symmetry-adapted construction cannot
use it. The derivation narrows the candidates with it separately, and the result
is the single operator built here.

A second route did exist, reaching $\mathbf{Z}$ by reducing the rank-$(\ell_1 +
\ell_2)$ product and grouping the resulting mappings numerically, which is how
it saw tracelessness: by working on an actual traceless product rather than
through the symmetry. It gave the same operator up to a scalar and was removed.
The closed form is exact and far cheaper, the general route having to pass
through the reduction of a rank-six tensor once $\ell_1 = \ell_2 = 3$.

    The condition differs from the one behind `coeff_C_even`. For odd `L` the

    l3 times with a single unit vector vanishes identically by antisymmetry and
    cannot fix the scale. The constant is fixed instead by the rate of that

    and $\mathbf{Y}^{\ell_2}$ from a unit vector $\mathbf{b}$,
