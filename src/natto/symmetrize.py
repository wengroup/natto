    r"""
    Get the unique permutations of the indices to fully symmetrize a tensor.
    that is obtained by tensor product with delta tensors.

    For example, `symmetry = xxyyaabb`, and `delta_indices = ab` means:
        1. indices 1 and 2 are symmetric (both associated with `x`), and indices 3 and
           4 are symmetric (both associated with `y`)
        2. indices 5 and 6 are symmetric (both associated with `a`), and indices 7 and
           8 are symmetric (both associated with `b`)
        3. indices pairs (5, 6) and (7, 8) are symmetric because both `a` and `b` are in
           `delta_indices`, meaning they are associated with delta tensors.

    So, we consider three types of symmetries:
        1. symmetries in other indices of the tensor
        2. minor symmetry in delta tensors (i.e. symmetry in the indices of each delta)
        3. major symmetry in delta tensors (i.e. symmetry between different deltas)

    For 2 and 3, consider, for example:
        delta_ij delta_kl = delta_ji delta_lk = delta_kl delta_ij,
    So, we have both minor and major symmetries in delta tensors.

    The above example can be though as symmetrizing a tensor Z obtained as:
        Z = X \otimes Y \otimes \delta \otimes \delta
    where `X` and `Y` are rank-2 symmetric tensors, and `\delta` are delta tensors.

    As another example, consider `symmetry = xxxxaabb` and `delta_indices = ab`, then
    it can be thought as symmetrizing a tensor Z obtained as:
        Z = X \otimes \delta \otimes \delta \otimes \delta
    where `X` is a rank-4 symmetric tensor, and `\delta` are delta tensors.

    As can be seen, `delta_indices` does not necessarily need to be associated with
    deltas. It can be indices of the same symmetric tensor. For example, the permutation
    of
        Z = X \otimes X \otimes Y \otimes Y
    where `X` and `Y` are rank-2 symmetric tensors,
    can be obtained using `symmetry = xxaabb` and `delta_indices = ab`.
